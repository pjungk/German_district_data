Generating a table to update an Anki deck of Japanese cities to include zoomed images of the marked city as well as a prefecture field. Also includes a few small fixes:
- Fixed 福山 Kanji and Reading fields
- Added audio for 八尾

One note:
It seems as if the 156th ranked entry is missing (This is already the case in the two previous versions here: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1055778242 and here https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1641416720).
But after some investigation it seems that it's just an error in the numbering. This statement based on a comparison to the population data in this source (https://citypopulation.de/en/japan/cities/). While the population values don't match 100% they are very close. In this table there don't seem to be any missing cities that could fit in this 156 spot between Kariya and Noda.
